## Schema

The app uses a JSON schema to define games and how to extract statistics from their outputs. Here's how it works:

### Basic Game Structure

```json
{
  "id": "wordle",
  "name": "Wordle",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"
}
```

Every game must include:

- `id`: A unique identifier (no spaces)
- `name`: Display name shown in the UI
- `url`: Link to play the game

### Result Parsing Rules

To track stats, add a `result_parsing_rules` object with `extractors`:

```json
"result_parsing_rules": {
  "extractors": [
    {
      "name": "completion_state",
      "regex": "\\d/6",
      "capture_groups_mapping": [
        {
          "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
          "group_index": 0,
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "attempts",
      "regex": "(\\d)/6",
      "capture_groups_mapping": [
        {
          "target_field_name": "Attempts",
          "group_index": 1,
          "type": "number"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Parser Types

The app supports these data types:

1. **boolean**: Checks if a pattern exists (returns true/false)

   ```json
   {
     "name": "completion_state",
     "regex": "\\d/6",
     "capture_groups_mapping": [
       {
         "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
         "group_index": 0,
         "type": "boolean"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **number**: Extracts numeric values from text (e.g., "3/6" â†’ 3)

   ```json
   {
     "name": "attempts",
     "regex": "(\\d)/6",
     "capture_groups_mapping": [
       {
         "target_field_name": "Attempts",
         "group_index": 1,
         "type": "number"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **count**: Counts occurrences of specific patterns or emojis
   ```json
   {
     "name": "tries",
     "regex": "ðŸŽ®",
     "capture_groups_mapping": [
       {
         "target_field_name": "Tries",
         "group_index": 0,
         "type": "count",
         "count_emojis": ["ðŸŸ¥", "ðŸŸ©"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Display Configuration

The `average_display` property controls how averages are shown on game cards:

```json
"average_display": {
  "field": "Attempts",
  "template": "30-day avg: {avg}/6",
  "days": 30
}
```

- `field`: The statistic to average
- `template`: Format string with `{avg}` placeholder
- `days`: Number of days to include in the average

### Complete Game Example

Here's a full example for Wordle:

```json
{
  "id": "wordle",
  "name": "Wordle",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html",
  "result_parsing_rules": {
    "extractors": [
      {
        "name": "completion_state",
        "regex": "\\d/6",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
            "group_index": 0,
            "type": "boolean"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "attempts",
        "regex": "(\\d)/6",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "Attempts",
            "group_index": 1,
            "type": "number"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "average_display": {
    "field": "Attempts",
    "template": "30-day avg: {avg}/6",
    "days": 30
  }
}
```

And for a game with emoji counting (like Framed):

```json
{
  "id": "framed",
  "name": "Framed",
  "url": "https://framed.wtf",
  "result_parsing_rules": {
    "extractors": [
      {
        "name": "completion_state",
        "regex": "ðŸŸ©",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
            "group_index": 0,
            "type": "boolean"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "tries",
        "regex": "ðŸŽ¥",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "Tries",
            "group_index": 0,
            "type": "count",
            "count_emojis": ["ðŸŸ¥", "ðŸŸ©"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "average_display": {
    "field": "Tries",
    "template": "30-day avg: {avg} tries",
    "days": 30
  }
}
```

### Adding New Games

To add a new game:

1. Understand the game's output format
2. Create the basic structure with id, name, and url
3. Define extractors that match patterns in the game output
4. Add an average_display configuration if needed

Games without parsing rules will still appear but won't track statistics.
