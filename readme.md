## Schema

The app uses a JSON schema to define games and how to extract statistics from their outputs. Here's how it works:

### Basic Game Structure

```json
{
  "id": "wordle",
  "name": "Wordle",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"
}
```

Every game must include:

- `id`: A unique identifier (no spaces)
- `name`: Display name shown in the UI
- `url`: Link to play the game

### Result Parsing Rules

To track stats, add a `result_parsing_rules` object with `extractors`:

```json
"result_parsing_rules": {
  "extractors": [
    {
      "name": "completion_state",
      "regex": "\\d/6",
      "capture_groups_mapping": [
        {
          "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
          "group_index": 0,
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "attempts",
      "regex": "(\\d)/6",
      "capture_groups_mapping": [
        {
          "target_field_name": "Attempts",
          "group_index": 1,
          "type": "number"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Parser Types

The app supports these data types for `capture_groups_mapping` entries:

1.  **`number`**: Extracts numeric values from text. The extracted value (from `group_index` or the full match of the extractor's `regex` if `group_index` is omitted) is parsed into a floating-point number. Commas are removed before parsing.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "attempts_parser", // Extractor name
      "regex": "Attempts: (\\\\d+)", // Main regex for the extractor
      "capture_groups_mapping": [
        {
          "target_field_name": "Attempts", // Field to store the result
          "group_index": 1, // Use the first captured group from "regex"
          "type": "number"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

2.  **`boolean`**: Determines a true/false value. Its behavior depends on whether it's used for the special `CompletionState` field or a regular field.

    - **For `CompletionState` field:**

      - The mapping **must** include an explicit `value: true` or `value: false` property.
      - The `parser.js` will look for all `CompletionState` boolean extractors.
      - If an extractor's `regex` matches and its mapping has `value: true`, it's a "success pattern."
      - If an extractor's `regex` matches and its mapping has `value: false`, it's a "failure pattern."
      - `CompletionState` is then determined as follows:
        - If both success and failure patterns are defined: `true` if a success pattern matches, `false` if a failure pattern matches. If neither matches, `CompletionState` is `undefined`.
        - If only success patterns are defined: `true` if a success pattern matches, otherwise `false`.
        - If only failure patterns are defined: `false` if a failure pattern matches, otherwise `true`.
        - If no `CompletionState` boolean extractors are defined, `CompletionState` remains `undefined` from parsing.
      - The `group_index` property is typically not needed for `CompletionState` boolean mappings, as the match of the extractor's `regex` itself is the condition.

      ```json
      // Example: Wordle-like success
      {
        "name": "wordle_success_state",
        "regex": "\\\\b[1-6]/6\\\\b", // e.g., "3/6"
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
            "type": "boolean",
            "value": true // Explicitly true on match
          }
        ]
      },
      // Example: Wordle-like failure
      {
        "name": "wordle_failure_state",
        "regex": "\\\\bX/6\\\\b", // e.g., "X/6"
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
            "type": "boolean",
            "value": false // Explicitly false on match
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    - **For other boolean fields (not `CompletionState`):**

      - If the main extractor's `regex` matches:
        - If the mapping includes an explicit `value: true` or `value: false`, that value is used.
        - If the mapping does _not_ include an explicit `value` property, the result defaults to `true`.
      - If the main extractor's `regex` does not match, the field is not set (remains undefined).

      ```json
      {
        "name": "feature_active_parser",
        "regex": "Feature: ENABLED", // Main regex for the extractor
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "IsFeatureActive",
            // "group_index" could be used if checking a part of the match
            "type": "boolean"
            // Defaults to true if "Feature: ENABLED" is found
            // Or, add "value: true" for clarity, or "value: some_condition" if needed
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

3.  **`count`**: Counts occurrences of patterns.

    - If `count_emojis` (an array of strings/emojis) is provided in the mapping:
      - It counts all occurrences of each specified emoji/string globally within the entire raw output.
      - The extractor's main `regex` is _not_ used for counting in this case.
    - If `count_emojis` is _not_ provided:
      - It counts all global occurrences of the extractor's main `regex` pattern within the entire raw output (using a global flag `g` and Unicode flag `u`).
    - The `group_index` property is not used for `count` type.

    ```json
    // Example: Counting specific emojis
    {
      "name": "reaction_counter",
      "regex": "Reactions:", // This regex is informational if count_emojis is used
      "capture_groups_mapping": [
        {
          "target_field_name": "ThumbsUpCount",
          "type": "count",
          "count_emojis": ["üëç", "üëçüèª", "üëçüèº", "üëçüèΩ", "üëçüèæ", "üëçüèø"]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    ```json
    // Example: Counting regex pattern matches
    {
      "name": "mistake_counter",
      "regex": "Mistake Found", // This regex IS used for counting
      "capture_groups_mapping": [
        {
          "target_field_name": "TotalMistakes",
          "type": "count"
          // Counts occurrences of "Mistake Found"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

**Important Notes on Extractor Logic:**

- For all mapping types **except `count`**, the main `regex` of the extractor **must match** somewhere in the raw output for its `capture_groups_mapping` to be processed. If the extractor's `regex` doesn't match, the fields defined in its mapping will not be set.
- For `count` type, the counting happens globally on the raw output, either based on `count_emojis` or the extractor's `regex`.

### Display Configuration

The `average_display` property controls how averages are shown on game cards:

```json
"average_display": {
  "field": "Attempts",
  "template": "30-day avg: {avg}/6",
  "days": 30
}
```

- `field`: The statistic to average
- `template`: Format string with `{avg}` placeholder
- `days`: Number of days to include in the average

### Complete Game Example

Here's a full example for Wordle, reflecting the detailed `CompletionState` logic:

```json
{
  "id": "wordle",
  "name": "Wordle",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html",
  "result_parsing_rules": {
    "extractors": [
      {
        "name": "completion_state_success",
        "regex": "\\\\b[1-6]/6\\\\b", // Matches "X/6" where X is 1-6
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
            "type": "boolean",
            "value": true
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "completion_state_failure",
        "regex": "\\\\bX/6\\\\b", // Matches "X/6" (loss)
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
            "type": "boolean",
            "value": false
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "attempts_parser",
        "regex": "\\\\b(\\\\d)/6\\\\b", // Captures the number of attempts if not X/6
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "Attempts",
            "group_index": 1,
            "type": "number"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "average_display": {
    "field": "Attempts",
    "template": "30-day avg: {avg}/6",
    "days": 30
  }
}
```

And for a game with emoji counting (like Framed):

```json
{
  "id": "framed",
  "name": "Framed",
  "url": "https://framed.wtf",
  "result_parsing_rules": {
    "extractors": [
      {
        "name": "completion_state_success_green_square",
        "regex": "üü©", // Green square indicates a successful guess/completion
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
            // "group_index": 0, // Not strictly needed if just checking regex match
            "type": "boolean",
            "value": true
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "tries_counter_emojis",
        // This regex is mainly for context if count_emojis is used,
        // but it could also be a broader pattern that contains the emojis.
        "regex": "Framed #\\\\d+",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "Tries",
            "type": "count",
            "count_emojis": ["üü•", "üü©"] // Counts red and green squares
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "average_display": {
    "field": "Tries",
    "template": "30-day avg: {avg} tries",
    "days": 30
  }
}
```

### Adding New Games

To add a new game:

1. Understand the game's output format
2. Create the basic structure with id, name, and url
3. Define extractors that match patterns in the game output
4. Add an average_display configuration if needed

Games without parsing rules will still appear but won't track statistics.
