## Schema

The app uses a simple JSON format to define games and how to extract stats from their outputs. Here's how it works:

### Basic Game Setup

```json
{
  "id": "wordle",
  "name": "Wordle",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"
}
```

Every game needs these three things:

- `id`: A short name for the game (no spaces)
- `name`: What players see in the app
- `url`: Where to play the game

### Adding Stats Tracking

To track stats, add `result_parsing_rules`. Here's how to track different types of stats:

#### 1. Numbers from Text

To get a number from text (like "3/6" from Wordle):

```json
{
  "name": "attempts",
  "regex": "(\\d)/6",
  "capture_groups_mapping": [
    {
      "target_field_name": "Attempts",
      "group_index": 1,
      "type": "number"
    }
  ]
}
```

This looks for a pattern like "3/6" and extracts the number before the slash.

#### 2. Counting Emojis

To count how many times an emoji appears (like counting green squares in Wordle):

```json
{
  "name": "green_tiles",
  "regex": "ðŸŸ©",
  "capture_groups_mapping": [
    {
      "target_field_name": "Green Tiles",
      "group_index": 0,
      "type": "count"
    }
  ]
}
```

This counts how many times ðŸŸ© appears in the output.

### Complete Example

Here's a complete example for Wordle that tracks:

- Number of attempts (e.g., "3/6")
- Number of green squares (ðŸŸ©)
- Number of yellow squares (ðŸŸ¨)
- Number of black squares (â¬›)

```json
[
  {
    "id": "wordle",
    "name": "Wordle",
    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html",
    "result_parsing_rules": {
      "extractors": [
        {
          "name": "attempts",
          "regex": "(\\d)/6",
          "capture_groups_mapping": [
            {
              "target_field_name": "Attempts",
              "group_index": 1,
              "type": "number"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "green_tiles",
          "regex": "ðŸŸ©",
          "capture_groups_mapping": [
            {
              "target_field_name": "Green Tiles",
              "group_index": 0,
              "type": "count"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "yellow_tiles",
          "regex": "ðŸŸ¨",
          "capture_groups_mapping": [
            {
              "target_field_name": "Yellow Tiles",
              "group_index": 0,
              "type": "count"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "black_tiles",
          "regex": "â¬›",
          "capture_groups_mapping": [
            {
              "target_field_name": "Black Tiles",
              "group_index": 0,
              "type": "count"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Adding a New Game

To add a new game:

1. Copy an existing game's structure
2. Change the `id`, `name`, and `url`
3. Add `result_parsing_rules` if you want to track stats
4. For each stat you want to track:
   - If it's a number in text, use `type: "number"`
   - If it's counting emojis or symbols, use `type: "count"`
