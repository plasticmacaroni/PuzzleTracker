## Schema

The app uses a JSON format to define games and how to extract stats from their outputs. Here's how it works:

### Basic Game Setup

```json
{
  "id": "wordle",
  "name": "Wordle",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"
}
```

Every game needs these three properties:

- `id`: A unique identifier (no spaces)
- `name`: Display name shown in the UI
- `url`: Link to play the game

### Tracking Game Results

To track stats, add `result_parsing_rules`. The app can track different types of data:

#### Parser Types

The parser supports several data types:

1. **number**: Extract a numeric value from text (e.g., "3/6" â†’ 3)
2. **count**: Count occurrences of emojis or patterns
3. **boolean**: Check if a pattern exists (true/false)

#### Completion State

Games can have a success/failure state, which affects:

- Which results are included in averages
- Whether success rate is shown in charts

```json
{
  "name": "completion_state",
  "regex": "\\d/6",
  "capture_groups_mapping": [
    {
      "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
      "group_index": 0,
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  ]
}
```

This example marks Wordle as successful if it contains a pattern like "3/6".

#### Parsing Numbers

To extract numeric values:

```json
{
  "name": "attempts",
  "regex": "(\\d)/6",
  "capture_groups_mapping": [
    {
      "target_field_name": "Attempts",
      "group_index": 1,
      "type": "number"
    }
  ]
}
```

This extracts the number from patterns like "3/6" into an "Attempts" field.

#### Counting Emojis

To count occurrences:

```json
{
  "name": "tries",
  "regex": "ðŸŽ®",
  "capture_groups_mapping": [
    {
      "target_field_name": "Tries",
      "group_index": 0,
      "type": "count",
      "count_emojis": ["ðŸŸ¥", "ðŸŸ©"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This counts the red and green squares in game results.

### Game-Specific Examples

#### 1. Wordle (Success/Failure + Attempts)

```json
{
  "id": "wordle",
  "name": "Wordle",
  "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html",
  "result_parsing_rules": {
    "extractors": [
      {
        "name": "completion_state",
        "regex": "\\d/6",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
            "group_index": 0,
            "type": "boolean"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "attempts",
        "regex": "(\\d)/6",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "Attempts",
            "group_index": 1,
            "type": "number"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "average_display": {
    "field": "Attempts",
    "template": "30-day avg: {avg}/6",
    "days": 30
  }
}
```

- **Success**: Has a number followed by "/6"
- **Failure**: Contains "X/6"
- **Display**: Average attempts of successful games

#### 2. Framed (Visual Game With Attempts)

```json
{
  "id": "framed",
  "name": "Framed",
  "url": "https://framed.wtf",
  "result_parsing_rules": {
    "extractors": [
      {
        "name": "completion_state",
        "regex": "ðŸŸ©",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "CompletionState",
            "group_index": 0,
            "type": "boolean"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "tries",
        "regex": "ðŸŽ¥",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "Tries",
            "group_index": 0,
            "type": "count",
            "count_emojis": ["ðŸŸ¥", "ðŸŸ©"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "average_display": {
    "field": "Tries",
    "template": "30-day avg: {avg} tries",
    "days": 30
  }
}
```

- **Success**: Contains at least one green square (ðŸŸ©)
- **Failure**: No green squares
- **Tracking**: Counts red and green squares as attempts
- **Note**: Ignores unused attempts (grey/white squares)

#### 3. Scrandle (Score-Only Game)

```json
{
  "id": "scrandle",
  "name": "Scrandle",
  "url": "https://scrandle.com/",
  "result_parsing_rules": {
    "extractors": [
      {
        "name": "score",
        "regex": "(\\d+)/10",
        "capture_groups_mapping": [
          {
            "target_field_name": "Score",
            "group_index": 1,
            "type": "number"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "average_display": {
    "field": "Score",
    "template": "30-day avg: {avg}/10",
    "days": 30
  }
}
```

- **No Success/Failure**: Game doesn't have winning/losing concept
- **Score**: Tracks correct answers out of 10
- **Chart**: No success rate shown, only score trends

### Display Configuration

The `average_display` section controls how averages appear on game cards:

```json
"average_display": {
  "field": "Attempts",    // Field to average
  "template": "30-day avg: {avg}/6",  // Display format
  "days": 30              // Time period
}
```

### How Charts Work

- Games with `CompletionState` show success rate (percentage of games won)
- Statistics only include successful attempts in averages if there's a completion state
- Games without completion state show all metrics without success rate

### Adding New Games

To add a new game:

1. Copy an existing game's structure
2. Change the `id`, `name`, and `url`
3. Define `result_parsing_rules` appropriate for the game:
   - Include `completion_state` if the game has success/failure
   - Add extractors for any numeric values you want to track
   - Choose appropriate display template

This schema design ensures flexibility across different game types while maintaining consistent tracking.
